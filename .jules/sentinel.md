## 2024-05-24 - Missing Event Listener Cleanup (Memory Leak / DoS)
**Vulnerability:** FastApi SSE and WebSocket endpoints (`gateway.py`) did not unsubscribe the `on_change` event listeners from `EventEmitter` when clients disconnected. Over time, each connection leaked an event listener, consuming memory and causing excessive callbacks, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability via resource exhaustion.
**Learning:** `EventEmitter` pattern in this architecture lacked an explicit `unsubscribe()` capability, making it impossible to manage listener lifecycles. Also, endpoints need `try...finally` blocks around the async generators and loops.
**Prevention:** Ensure that any event listener registered inside an endpoint explicitly implements a `try...finally` teardown using a corresponding `unsubscribe()` method to cleanly close out the connection state.
