# LedgerMind Release Notes (v3.0.3)

**February 28, 2026**

LedgerMind v3.0.3 focuses on **extreme performance optimization** for mobile 
and resource-constrained environments. This release introduces lazy loading 
mechanisms, optimizes startup latency, and programmatically activates the 
Balanced Normative Model for more intelligent knowledge retrieval.

## Major Changes

### Startup & Latency Optimization
We've overhauled the initialization process to ensure LedgerMind remains 
responsive in environments like Android/Termux.
- **Lazy Library Loading:** Heavy libraries such as `transformers` and 
  `sentence-transformers` are now loaded only on demand. If you use a GGUF model 
  (the default), these libraries are never imported, eliminating up to 20 
  seconds of startup delay.
- **Instant GGUF Initialization:** The Jina v5 Q4 GGUF model is now the standard 
  default, providing near-instantaneous startup when used with 
  `llama-cpp-python`.
- **Database-Driven Configuration:** The system now prioritizes model settings 
  stored in the metadata database (`sys_config`) over hardcoded defaults, 
  allowing for seamless environmental tuning.

### Programmatic Normative Ranking
The Balanced Normative Model is now fully implemented within the core search 
engine.
- **Authority Weighting:** Confirmed `Decisions` automatically receive a 
  **+35% relevance boost** over raw `Proposals`.
- **Maturity Multipliers:** Knowledge retrieval is now phase-aware, applying 
  multipliers for `CANONICAL` (1.5x) and `EMERGENT` (1.2x) records.
- **Clipping & Normalization:** Implemented score clipping to ensure threshold 
  consistency across different knowledge Kind types.

### Reliability & Bug Fixes
- **Vector Stability:** Fixed `AxisError` and dimension mismatch issues when 
  processing single-document updates or using mock objects in tests.
- **Memory Initialization:** Corrected the initialization order to ensure 
  metadata stores are ready before the vector engine attempts to load 
  configuration.
- **Mock-Safe Logic:** Improved the vector store search logic to be resilient 
  against MagicMock structures commonly used in advanced testing scenarios.

### Test Suite Evolution
- **Lazy Loading Verification:** Added dedicated tests to confirm that heavy 
  dependencies are not imported unnecessarily.
- **Normative Weighting Tests:** New test cases verify the prioritized 
  retrieval of Canonical Decisions over Emergent Patterns.
- **Environmental Adaptation:** Updated the entire test suite to respect 
  mobile-specific path constraints and dependency availability.
