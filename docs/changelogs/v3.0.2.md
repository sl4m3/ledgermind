# Release v3.0.2

**February 28, 2026**

LedgerMind v3.0.2 introduces a refined **Balanced Ranking Model** for search results and formalizes the **Normative Authority** logic for knowledge evolution. This release also focuses on hardening the lifecycle validation suite and optimizing search precision.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Balanced Ranking & Scoring
The search engine now employs a more nuanced ranking algorithm (RRF-based) that incorporates the **Lifecycle State** of each memory:
- **Kind-Based Weighting:** Authoritative `Decisions` now receive a ~35% boost compared to `Proposals`, ensuring project rules are prioritized.
- **Phase Multipliers:** Results are scaled based on their maturity: `CANONICAL` (1.5x), `EMERGENT` (1.2x), and `PATTERN` (1.0x).
- **Vitality Aware:** Decaying (0.5x) and Dormant (0.2x) memories are automatically de-prioritized in favor of active knowledge.

### 2. Formalized Normative Authority
Improved the logic that determines when a behavioral pattern (`PATTERN`) or an observation (`EMERGENT`) should be promoted to a project rule (`DECISION`):
- **Balanced Model:** Implemented a weighted authority score based on Confidence, Utility (Success Signals), and Removal Cost.
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** The transition threshold is now sensitive to the current lifecycle phase, requiring higher authority for emergent knowledge to become canonical.

### 3. Lifecycle Stability & Fixes
- **Test Robustness:** Fixed a critical `AttributeError` in the lifecycle validation suite (`tests/lg.py`) by adding proper null checks for metadata records during rapid decay simulations.
- **Synchronized Expectations:** Updated test suites to align with the latest core logic regarding intervention confidence levels and scope inheritance.
- **Injection Precision:** Fine-tuned the `IntegrationBridge` relevance thresholds to prevent false positives during context injection when using high lifecycle multipliers.
