# Changelog v3.1.2 (March 1, 2026)

LedgerMind v3.1.2 focus on production-grade reliability and security
hardening. This release introduces a standardized error handling pattern,
high-performance connection pooling for episodic storage, and comprehensive
monitoring capabilities.

## Highlights

### 🛡️ Production Hardening
- **Unified Error Handling:** Introduced the `Result` pattern across core
  components, providing explicit success/failure states and standardized error
  codes for better predictability.
- **Input Sanitization:** Implemented multi-layer sanitization for all incoming
  memory events, including XSS protection, Unicode attack prevention, and
  content size enforcement.

### ⚡ Performance & Stability
- **SQLAlchemy Connection Pooling:** Migrated `EpisodicStore` to use SQLAlchemy's
  `QueuePool`. This significantly reduces connection overhead and file
  descriptor usage under high concurrent loads.
- **Memory Performance:** Maintained peak hybrid search performance (~600 ops/s)
  while adding security and validation layers.

### 📊 Monitoring & Health
- **Health Check System:** Added detailed health monitoring endpoints
  (`/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`) providing real-time status of
  databases, Git repositories, vector indices, and system resources.
- **Android/Termux Support:** Hardened system resource monitoring to gracefully
  handle permission restrictions in mobile environments.
