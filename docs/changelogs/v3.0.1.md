# Release v3.0.1

**February 27, 2026**

LedgerMind v3.0.1 is a maintenance and optimization release focused on improving core performance, enhancing reflection intelligence, and ensuring system stability in complex multi-test environments.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization
This release introduces significant optimizations to the recording pipeline:
- **Incremental Integrity Validation:** Replaced full repository scans with targeted incremental checks ($O(1)$ complexity instead of $O(N)$). This prevents performance degradation as the knowledge base grows.
- **Embedding Caching:** Implemented intelligent caching of vector embeddings during the decision recording process. Pre-computed vectors from similarity checks are now reused for indexing, eliminating redundant model calls.
- **Database Indexing:** Added specialized indexes to the episodic store to accelerate duplicate detection and event retrieval.

### 2. Enhanced Reflection & Distillation
- **Session-Based Distillation:** Improved the trajectory extraction logic to correctly handle autonomous agent turns and multi-stage tasks.
- **Intelligence Refinement:** Enhanced the reflection engine's ability to cluster related events and identify behavioral patterns across session boundaries.

### 3. System Integrity & Stability
- **Cache Isolation:** Fixed a critical issue in the integrity checker where data cache leaked between different storage paths, ensuring stability during parallel test runs or when managing multiple repositories.
- **Consistent Serialization:** Enabled sorted JSON key serialization for consistent hashing and reliable duplicate detection in episodic memory.
- **Dynamic Versioning:** Standardized version management across core components, server contracts, and client specifications.
