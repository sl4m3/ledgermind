# Release v3.0.0

**February 27, 2026**

LedgerMind v3.0.0 is a major milestone that transforms the system from a passive memory store into a proactive **Autonomous Knowledge Core**. This release introduces the **DecisionStream Lifecycle Engine**, **Procedural Distillation**, and deep **Zero-Touch Integration** for professional AI agents.

## Major New Features

### 1. DecisionStream Lifecycle & Vitality Engine
The static "Decision" model is replaced by a dynamic **DecisionStream** that evolves through autonomous phases:
- **Phases:** `PATTERN` → `EMERGENT` → `CANONICAL`.
- **Temporal Signal Analysis:** Evaluates reinforcement density, interval stability (variance tracking), and lifetime coverage to protect against short-term bursts of activity.
- **Vitality Tracking:** Knowledge is now tracked as `ACTIVE`, `DECAYING`, or `DORMANT`. 
- **Confidence Momentum:** Confidence scores now incorporate historical momentum, allowing successful patterns to crystallize faster while maintaining stability.

### 2. Procedural Distillation
LedgerMind now automatically "distills" raw episodic experience into structured procedural knowledge:
- **Autonomous Step Extraction:** Converts successful interaction trajectories into `procedural.steps`.
- **MemP (Memory-to-Procedure) Linking:** Explicitly links high-level decisions to the specific technical steps required to implement them.
- **Target Inheritance:** Automatically resolves missing context in distilled instructions by inheriting project-level targets.

### 3. Deep Zero-Touch Integration (Hooks Pack)
The new `ledgermind install <client>` command enables transparent memory management:
- **Shadow Context:** Automatically injects relevant memory into every agent prompt before it reaches the LLM.
- **Auto-Recording:** Transparently captures every interaction and git commit without the agent needing to manually call tools.
- **VS Code Hardcore Mode:** Proactive monitoring of terminal data and file saves for sub-millisecond context enrichment.

### 4. Advanced Audit & Security Hardening
- **Path Traversal Protection:** Strict absolute path validation and symlink prevention in the project scanner.
- **Atomic Transaction Integrity:** Enhanced SQLite transaction management with `SAVEPOINT` support and thread-local isolation to prevent corruption during concurrent operations.
- **Git Audit Cohesion:** Every memory change is cryptographically tracked in a companion Git repository with automatic history synchronization.

### 5. Performance & Reliability
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Improved search relevance by combining Keyword (FTS5) and Vector (4-bit GGUF) scores with evidence-based boosting.
- **Self-Healing Metadata:** Automatic reconstruction of the relational index from Markdown source files if corruption or desync is detected.
- **Jina v5 Support:** Native support for 4-bit quantized Jina v5 Small embeddings with automatic model downloading.
