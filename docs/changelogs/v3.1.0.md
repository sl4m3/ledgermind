# Changelog v3.1.0 (March 1, 2026)

LedgerMind v3.1.0 represents a significant leap in both autonomous reasoning 
capabilities and raw operational performance. This release focuses on 
"Human-in-the-Loop" clarity through LLM enrichment and "Sub-millisecond" 
responsiveness for CLI integrations.

## Highlights

### 🧠 Autonomous Knowledge Enrichment
- **Behavioral Pattern Summarization:** The reasoning engine now distills raw 
  event clusters into human-readable architectural insights using LLMs.
- **Asynchronous Pipeline:** Enrichment tasks are now queued and processed in 
  the background, ensuring zero latency during active agent sessions.
- **Local Client Support:** Added support for local CLI-based LLMs (e.g., 
  Ollama, Gemini CLI) for secure, offline knowledge processing.

### ⚡ Extreme Performance Optimization
- **Search Fast-Path:** Simple keyword queries now bypass heavy vector 
  processing, reaching speeds over **18,000 ops/sec** via optimized SQLite FTS5.
- **Lazy Component Loading:** The vector store and heavy ML libraries are 
  loaded only when needed, reducing startup time by 60%.
- **Batch Metadata Fetching:** Eliminated N+1 query issues in search results by 
  implementing batched metadata resolution.

### 🛡️ Hardened Security & Integrity
- **SAST Integration:** Bandit security scanning is now part of the standard 
  test suite and CI pipeline.
- **Robust Transactions:** Fixed edge cases in SQLite SAVEPOINT logic and 
  multi-process locking.
- **Atomic Vector Ops:** Improved stability of vector index updates during 
  concurrent writes.

### 🎮 Enhanced CLI Experience
- **Interactive Init:** The `init` command now features an interactive TUI 
  with arrow-key menus for easier project configuration.
- **Zero-Touch Hooks:** Relocated client hooks to project-local storage for 
  better isolation and portability.
