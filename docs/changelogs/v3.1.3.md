# Changelog v3.1.3 (March 2, 2026)

LedgerMind v3.1.3 focuses on real-time synchronization, hypothesis unification,
and improved technical log recording.

## Highlights

### ⚡ Real-Time Synchronization
- **Claude Code Stop Hook:** Implemented instant history synchronization for
  Claude Code using the new `Stop` hook. This ensures that every interaction is
  recorded immediately after the task finishes.
- **Hybrid Deduplication:** Added a robust deduplication mechanism (UUID + 
  content hash) in `bridge-context` to prevent duplicate prompt recording during 
  hook execution.

### 🧠 Reasoning Evolution
- **Hypothesis Unification:** Unified procedural and behavioral hypothesis 
  lifecycles within the reasoning engine. This provides a consistent evolution 
  path for all types of discovered patterns.

### 🛡️ Security & Scaling
- **Increased Event Limits:** Memory event length limit increased to 500KB to
  accommodate large technical logs and complex code snippets.
- **Relaxed Technical Validation:** Adjusted validation rules to allow recording
  of legitimate code blocks and logs that were previously flagged by overly
  strict security heuristics.
- **Secure Interaction Recording:** Interaction recording via stdin pipes is now
  more robust and secure.
